(key)   j @email.com(Value)


Laura 514 333 3333(Value)
(key)   L @email.com(Value)


If I want to get the email address fro John 


array[] { Mary, John, Laura}

List<> { Object1, Object2,Object3}

List<string, string> { Mary(value),m @email.com(value)}
{ John(value),j @email.com(value)}
{ Laura,L @email.com}
I can not do the search sort delete edit based on the key 

Dictionary<string,string> {[Mary, m@email.com],[John, j@email.com],[Laura, L@email.com]
element in dictionary divided to Key and Value (first data is key ) (second is value)

But in dictionary I can do the search based on the key 
Mary is a key and I can access to the all information related to mary 
I have Methods, functions  based on the key
